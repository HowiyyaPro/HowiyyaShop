                         The history of Tatreez, and indeed the history of Palestinians in general, can be divided into two parts:
                        life in Palestine before the 1948 Nakba, the Nakba in Arabic, and life after the Nakba. <br> <br>
                        Traditionally and historically, cross-stitch embroidery is a women's collective creative outlet in Palestine,
                        dating back centuries, but in fact it has been taking shape as distinctly Palestinian since the mid-nineteenth century,
                        and was typically practiced by village women in Palestine, called peasants. <br>
                        We took a quick look at the amazing history of Palestinian embroidery, which is constantly evolving as the story of the fate of the
                        Palestinian people is constantly being written. A timeline of Palestinian embroidery

                        ‏In the olden days, Palestinian girls would be taught the art of tatreez from age six or seven, inspirina them to keep alive this unique, time intensive and beautiful craft and thereby preserve their
                            legacy as Palestinians and more specifically as Palestinian women. <br> <br>
                            Tatraz was (and still is, for some) an essential part of Palestinian women's lives. They give meaning and identity to clothing (“the garment”) by using unique means of creativity to express themselves as a people and as individuals. It also enhances
                            the wearer's identity by bringing a creative touch to a daily basis, closely linking his or her identity slaves to their creation tatreez "thobes".

                 The iconic cross stitch Tatreez experienced a multitude of influences over the centuries, as did the land of Palestine itself. Notable time periods affecting and influencing all walks of Palestinian lite are the Ottoman Occupation (1516 1918) as well as the British Mandate (1918 - 1948). Each change Palestine and its people underwent was commemorated in the art of tatreez embroidery. The artisans would add layers to the traditional foundations of tatreez which included usina colorful textiles such as silk, the use of gcometric patterns, usina specific symbols that could be found in the landscapes surrounding them and the villages specific landmarks. Influenced and inspired by certain historical time periods the foundations of Tatreez would then be transformed - still kept recognizable into something new, for example weaving new symbols into the classic designs, which were derived from changes in

A monumental turming point in Palestinian history is the 1948 Nakba, which has repercussions to this very day. Through this violent experience, the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, the rendering of some close to 850,000 people as refugees within their own country, every aspect of Palestinian life then was branded with a new laver of identity: sumoud (resilience). Since the end goal of the suttocating Israeli Occupation is the burial of Palestinian existence ilsclf, 1948 and the years more it, were defined by the colonizer's attempt to stifle all aspects of Palestinian life includina their art makina. After some fears of temporary suspension of tatreez making in order to focus on more immediate nces- the ancient skill of cross-stitch art was picked up again, this time embedded in the tapestry of Paleslinian resistance and resilience. new political art form. A poetic teature of this tragedy is the coming together of Palestinians on a whole new scale, supporling each other and exchanging ideas, knowledge, way of lite unique to specitic locations within Palestine. So, the distinctive and always exquisite styles of tatreez dresses, unique to their specific village, and the how-to was then exchanged among Palestinian women, creating yet a new style of tatreez, a mash-up and combining of different styles and reviving the ancient craft after a slumber.             <br>
